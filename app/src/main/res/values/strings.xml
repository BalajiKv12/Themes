    <string name="hello_ben_10">The “Balanced Diet” is a diet that contains all of the necessary ingredients in nearly the required quantity. A balanced diet is one that contributes to the maintenance or improvement of overall health. We should eat a well-balanced diet that includes liquids, adequate proteins, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and calories. To maintain a healthy body, we must eat fresh fruits, salad, green leafy vegetables, milk, egg, yoghurt, and so on on a regular basis. We need iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and trace amounts of iodine, copper, and other minerals. Milk is possibly the only single item that can be considered a balanced diet in and of itself.</string>
